						<p>As a recent graduate of what some refer to as a coding bootcamp
							 (I'm leaving comments on the <a href="https://lambdaschool.com/">Lambda School</a> experience for another
							 post),
							 I have a vested interest in understanding the current state of
							 hiring affairs. If you've stumbled across this blog post from the
							 future, I would confidently assume your familiarity with COVID-19
							 and its impact on everything from mundane errands to the most
							 salient political matters. With the restrictions
							 imposed by the virus on social proximity, hiring for jobs that
							 would normally require an in-person interview saw a dramatic change almost
							 overnight. When I began my foray into Lambda School's Data Science
							 program, I was advised to set my sights <em>away</em> from remote
							 employment opportunities; with the advent of COVID-19, remote
							 work has become the norm, albeit begrudgingly. The need for employees
							 to stay home led to some companies carrying out layoffs, while
							 others made plans to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/retailwire/2020/08/18/rei-sells-its-headquarters-others-should-take-notice/#2c8589f13166">sell their headquarters</a>.
							 With these impacts in mind, I sought to investigate the current state of hiring in
							 the tech sector, resorting to <a href="https://www.indeed.com/">Indeed</a>
							 for some current insights into the tech hiring status.

						<h3>Remote Work</h3>
						<p>With a quick search for your respective tech job role on Indeed,
						   you can see a number of details about the jobs you seek, including
						   a 'Remote' flag on each job card when the job poster wants to
						   explicitly mark the job with that opportunity. I used that marker
						   to help identify jobs that could offer remote positions, although
							 it's entirely possible that some jobs could be temporarily remote
							 for the time being. The great majority of postings (more than 80%)
							 were not marked as remote in general, but we <em>can</em> see a marked
							 shift in the adoption of the 'Remote' tag by posts as the weeks go
							 by.
						 </p>
						<figure class="text-center"><!-- Remote Proportion -->

  						<figcaption class="figure-caption">Data from indeed.com</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p>As seen in the figure above, the proportion of jobs marked as 'Remote'
						   by companies posting jobs on Indeed steadily rose from below 13%
						   to nearly 20% (the spike in the beginning of the plot could be a
						   result of a generalization; posts any older than 30 days get marked
						   as '30+ days old', so the true rate of change is likely hidden in
							 that discrepancy). At the time of this post, it's unclear whether
							 this rise will continue. If it does, the vari
