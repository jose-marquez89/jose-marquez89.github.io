If you've been stunned by your Azure bill climbing due to Fabric capacity costs, you're not alone. "Pay-as-you-go" sounds flexible, but it can sneak up on you like any cloud service. You'll foot the bill for idle time unless you take control. These five strategies will help trim costs without sacrificing productivity. We'll walk through each, with practical tips drawn from real usage patterns.

### 1. Pause When You're Not Using It

Pay-as-you-go in Fabric isn't truly "pay for what you use". It mirrors Azure's "always-on" metering until you hit pause. If your workloads are 9-to-5 or bursty, leaving capacity running overnight or over weekends means you're paying full price for unused capacity. This is particularly important as your capacity size increases. The fix is simple: pause your capacity via the Fabric admin portal or automate it to cap costs when the capacity is not being used (I plan to cover that automation in another post).

### 2. Pick the Right Capacity Size

Starting with an oversized SKU like F64 when F8 would do is a common mistake. It's a bit like renting a semi-truck for grocery runs. Fabric's built-in Capacity Metrics app is your best friend here. It tracks CU (Capacity Unit) usage, showing peaks and idle time. If you're consistently under 50% utilization, consider dropping to the next SKU down (e.g. from F16 to F8) and monitor for a week or so. It takes a couple clicks in the Azure portal and can literally cut your costs in half.

### 3. Leverage Autoscale for Bursty Jobs

For Spark workloads with infrequent spikes, a fixed large capacity just to handle bursts is overkill. You're paying premium for rare events. In the Fabric admin portal, enable autoscale billing for Spark, which lets compute flex up during peaks and down to base levels otherwise, billing truly only for what you consume. It's perfect for ETL jobs that hit hard a few times per day but idle most of the time. As of the time of this post, autoscale billing for Fabric Warehouse is [planned](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fwhy-is-autoscale-billing-only-for-spark-v0-rzttxa6cv5rf1.png%3Fwidth%3D1052%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D45b87126a1a72315cdaa1a5bf9e97e01c7a56cb4) but not yet available.

### 4. Optimize Your Workloads Ruthlessly

Inefficient queries are the silent killers of Fabric budgets. Poorly tuned Spark jobs or Warehouse scans can burn CUs like wildfire. Dive into the Capacity Metrics app or query logs to spot consumption bottlenecks, then refactor: switch to incremental loads, be intentional about partitions, or adjust broadcast join behavior. Here's a bit of uncommon knowledge: for lighter tasks, you can ditch full Spark for Python-only notebooks with [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/). It's in-memory, super fast, pre-installed and uses a fraction of the CUs since the notebooks are capped at 2 vCores and 16GB of memory by default (you can increase this if you need more).

### 5. Switch to Reserved Capacity Long-Term

If pausing doesn't make sense for your workloads and Fabric is a core part of your analytics stack, the flexibility of pay-as-you-go comes at a premium. You'll be leaving up to 41% in savings on the table. Commit to a 1 or 3 year reserved capacity for steady, 24/7 workloads like production pipelines, and pocket the savings. Once committed, cancellation isn't really an option and pausing the capacity has no cost benefits, so baseline your usage first with metrics.

All in all, these tweaks can turn your Fabric experience from a budget black hole into a lean machine. Start with metrics monitoring with the Capacity Metrics app as it's free insight that pays dividends. Experiment small, measure everything, and scale smart; your wallet (and your reputation with Finance) will thank you.
